// Write a C program to check whether a number is Perfect number or not.

/*
Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
For example: 6 is the first perfect number
Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3
Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Hence 6 is a perfect number.
