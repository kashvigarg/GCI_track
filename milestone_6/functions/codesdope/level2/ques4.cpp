/*Define a function named 'perfect' that determines if parameter number is a perfect number. Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000.
[An integer number is said to be "perfect number" if its factors, including 1(but not the number itself), sum to the number. E.g., 6 is a perfect number because 6=1+2+3].
