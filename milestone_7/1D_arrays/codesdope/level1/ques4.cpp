/*4.
Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in another array but in reverse order.
5.
Write a program to find the sum and product of all elements of an array.
6.
Initialize and print all elements of a 2D array.
7.
Find the largest and smallest elements of an array.
8.
Write a program to check if elements of an array are same or not it read from front or back. E.g.-
2	3	15	15	3	2
9.
Take an array of 10 elements. Split it into middle and store the elements in two dfferent arrays. E.g.-
INITIAL array :
58	24	13	15	63	9	8	81	1	78

After spliting :
58	24	13	15	63
9	8	81	1	78
10.
Consider an integer array, the number of elements in which is determined by the user. The elements are also taken as input from the user. Write a program to find those pair of elements that has the maximum and minimum difference among all element pairs.
11.
If the input array is [10, 12, 20, 30, 25, 40, 32, 31, 35, 50, 60], your program should be able to find that the subarray lies between the indexes 3 and 8.
12.
